My Discord bot (update of unreasonable-llama-discord for Ollama)

This bot is a bridge between Discord and Ollama, with it's own user and session management system.

## Features

- Bot's response can be triggered simply by mentioning it in a message.
- By default, the bot uses the recent chat history as context. Amount of messages stored in context depends on maximum context size and bot's configuration.
- Sessions are stored in bot's database and active session can be selected by the user via bot commands.
- Users can start their own, private sessions that contain only the conversation between them and the bot. Sessions are identified by IDs provided by the user.
- Sessions are bound to user ID
- Users can delete their private sessions (as whole)
- Users can select the model for each session. Default model is configured by bot's administrator.
- Users can set the system prompt for each session.

The bot uses local sqlite3 database to store the data.
Configuration is stored in configparser-compatible .ini file.

## Bot commands

Commands can be triggered by mentioning the bot, followed by command name and arguments.
For the sake of following examples, `$llm` is the bot's command prefix, and `@username` is the username.
Bot should respond to the message that triggered the command. If the command name is unknown, bot will respond with `Unknown command: [command name]`.

### Trigger bot response

```text
$llm what's the capital of Poland?
```

Example bot's response:

```text
The capital of Poland is Warsaw.
```

```

### Create new session

```text
$llm-new-session MyCustomSession
```

Bot's response:

```text
*Created and switched to MyCustomSession*
```

This will also automatically switch to MyCustomSession.

### List available sessions

```text
$llm-list-sessions
```

Bot's response:

```text
List of your sessions:
- MyCustomSession
- OtherSession
```

### Change current session

```text
$llm-change-session OtherSession
```

Bot's response:

```text
Changed your session to OtherSession
```

To switch to global session, use `global` as the name. You cannot create a session with this name.

### Remove a session

```text
$llm-remove-session OtherSession
```

Bot's response:

```text
Removed session OtherSession
```

If current session is removed, bot will fallback to global session.
In that case, the response will be:

```text
Removed current session OtherSession, switching to global session.
```

### Check current session size

```text
$llm-get-session-size MyCustomSession
```

Bot's response:

```text
Session MyCustomSession currently contains 1024 tokens.
```

### Set system prompt for current session

```text
$llm-set-system-prompt You are a helpful assistant.
```

Bot's response:

```text
Changed system prompt for current session to `You are a helpful assistant.`
```

### List available models

```text
$llm-list-models
```

Bot's response:

```text
Available models:
- ModelAName - 8B parameters, Q6_K quantization
- ModelBName - 14B parameters, Q4_K_XL quantization
- ModelCName - 4B parameters, Q8_0 quantization
```

Models can be blacklisted in configuration to prevent them from showing on the list.

### Set model for a session

```text
$llm-set-session-model MyCustomSession ModelCName
```

Bot's response:

```text
Changed model for session MyCustomSession to ModelCName (4B parameters, Q8_0 quantization)
```

Only the bot's admin can set the model for `global` session.
If an unauthorized user tries to do that, bot responds with `Error: you are not authorized to do that.`

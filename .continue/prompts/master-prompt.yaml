    description: Keep the code simple and use provided tools.
    prompt: You are currently in agent mode and have full access to the project via tools. Assume the project is currently configured correctly, unless the user tells you otherwise. Keep the code simple. If you think a comment is necessary, try to simplify the code in order to be easily understandable without it. Do not add any unnecessary comments. Use sqlite for persistent data storage, configparser for configuration. Use latest Python 3.13 features wherever possible. Remember that the bot's source code is in `bot` subdirectory, not `src`. Make sure to always edit the files if they exist, do not blindly overwrite them.
